        <p>Donate to the Village (Free)dge initiative to send a card! We not only want to spread love to one another but also to those who are doing the work in their communities.
          <br>
          <br>The (Free)dge was started to bridge the gap in hunger throughout communities in South Florida. Yes, there are many food drives but some people don’t have cars to get there, and that’s where the (Free)dge comes in. Learn more about the initiative <a target="blank" href="https://www.villagefreedge.com/">here</a>.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can send your donation via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/tcgive-back-initiatives?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1">Gofundme</a>. There is no max or minimum amount required.</em></p>
